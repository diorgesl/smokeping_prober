Prometheus style "smokeping" prober.

![Example Graph](example-graph.png)

## Overview

This prober sends a series of ICMP (or UDP) pings to a target and records the responses in Prometheus histogram metrics.

Args:

```

## Configuration

The prober can take a list of targets and parameters from the command line or from a yaml config file.

Example config:

```yaml
---
targets:
- hosts:
  - host1
  - host2
  interval: 1s # Duration, Default 1s.
  network: ip # One of ip, ip4, ip6. Default: ip (automatic IPv4/IPv6)
  protocol: icmp # One of icmp, udp. Default: icmp (Requires privileged operation)
  size: 56 # Packet data size in bytes. Default 56 (Range: 24 - 65535)
  source: 127.0.1.1 # Souce IP address to use. Default: None (automatic selection)
```

In each host group the `interval`, `network`, and `protocol` are optional.

The interval Duration is in [Go time.ParseDuration()](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration) syntax.

The config is read on startup, and can be reloaded with the SIGHUP signal, or with an HTTP POST to the URI path `/-/reload`.

### Remote ping through a Huawei VRP router

A target group with `router:` is pinged by the router instead of the local host. The prober keeps persistent SSH sessions to the router and runs `ping -a <link source> <target>` once per link, so a router with several uplinks produces one series per uplink, told apart by the `link` label.

```yaml
routers:
- name: ne8k
  address: 10.0.0.1:22
  username: smokeping
  password_file: /etc/smokeping_prober/ne8k.pass  # or private_key_file
  known_hosts: /etc/smokeping_prober/known_hosts  # or insecure_skip_host_key: true (lab only)
  sessions: 5                                     # Default 5
  links:
  - name: isp-a
    source: 192.0.2.1
    source6: 2001:db8::1   # Optional, needed for IPv6 targets
  - name: isp-b
    source: 198.51.100.1

targets:
- host: 8.8.8.8
  router: ne8k
  interval: 1m          # Default 1m for router targets
  count: 10             # Echo requests per run (-c). Default 10
  packet_interval: 50ms # Time between requests (-m). Default 50ms
  timeout: 500ms        # Wait per reply (-t). Default 500ms
  # links: [isp-a]      # Optional subset of the router links
```

Notes:

* The router reports round-trip times in whole milliseconds, so remote histograms have 1 ms resolution.
* `protocol` is ignored and `source` cannot be set for router targets; the source comes from each link.
* Create `known_hosts` with `ssh-keyscan -p 22 10.0.0.1 > known_hosts` and check the fingerprint on the router.
* The SSH user only needs to run `ping` and `screen-length 0 temporary` in user view.
* A failed SSH session, timeout or unexpected output never counts as packet loss. It shows up in `smokeping_remote_errors_total` instead.

## Building and running

Requires Go >= 1.22

```console
go install github.com/SuperQ/smokeping_prober@latest
sudo setcap cap_net_raw=+ep ${GOPATH}/bin/smokeping_prober
```

On multi-cpu systems it is typically more efficient to limit the prober to one CPU in order to
reduce the number of cross-cpu context switches and packet copies from the kernel to the prober.
This can be done with the `GOMAXPROCS` environment variable, or by using container (cgroup) limits.

```console
export GOMAXPROCS=1
./smokeping_prober <targets>
```

## Docker

```bash
docker run \
  -p 9374:9374 \
  --privileged \
  --env GOMAXPROCS=1 \
  quay.io/superq/smokeping-prober:latest \
  some-ping-target.example.com
```

## Metrics

 Metric Name                            | Type       | Description
----------------------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------
 smokeping\_requests\_total             | Counter    | Counter of pings sent.
 smokeping\_response\_duration\_seconds | Histogram  | Ping response duration.
 smokeping\_response\_ttl               | Gauge      | The last response Time To Live (TTL).
 smokeping\_response\_duplicates\_total | Counter    | The number of duplicated response packets.
 smokeping\_receive\_errors\_total      | Counter    | The number of errors when Pinger attempts to receive packets.
 smokeping\_send\_errors\_total         | Counter    | The number of errors when Pinger attempts to send packets.
 smokeping\_remote\_sessions\_up         | Gauge      | SSH sessions connected and ready per router.
 smokeping\_remote\_errors\_total        | Counter    | Remote ping runs with no result, by `reason` (`connect`, `timeout`, `parse`).
 smokeping\_remote\_jobs\_skipped\_total | Counter    | Remote runs dropped because the previous run for the same target and link was still pending.

### TLS and basic authentication

The Smokeping Prober supports TLS and basic authentication.

To use TLS and/or basic authentication, you need to pass a configuration file
using the `--web.config.file` parameter. The format of the file is described
[in the exporter-toolkit repository](https://github.com/prometheus/exporter-toolkit/blob/master/docs/web-configuration.md).


### Health check

A health check can be requested in the URI path `/-/healthy`.
